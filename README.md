#When My Code Sucked - And How I Fixed It

This repo contains bad, and good examples of the different facets of refactoring.
Can be read independently, or as part of a presentation I give at talks.

The main areas of consideration are:

- **Readability** - Is your code readable? Does it follow standards? Can you easily determine the route of execution?
- **Reusability** - How tightly is your code coupled to the code base? Can you abstract it into it's own library? Would you want to?
- **Testability** - How easy is it to isolate and test the code, your code and nothing but your code? Are you using a third party class or object? Have you considered your dependancies?
